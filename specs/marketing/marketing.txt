Marketing Dashboard

I worked with Rishi on different Marketing operations I would need to include. Some basic features would include a marketing calendar that will show previous events as well as new ones (a toggle to switch between all events and recent events), previous event information, notes on previous events, as well as extra event statistics with possible integration with Instagram to receive updates that way as well.
