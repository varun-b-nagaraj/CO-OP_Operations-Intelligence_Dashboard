Chick-fil-A Dashboard

I worked with Anishka Vasanthu on different Chick-fil-A operations I would need to include. Some basic features would include order quantity, left-over quantity, request quantity(how many people asked for CFA after it sold out), the amount of sales generated from Chick-fil-A as well as revenue generated to estimate net-profit/loss.

Initial Menu of Products:
CFA Strip Sliders: Buy for 2.45 and sell for 4.00
CFA Half Grilled Cool Wrap: Buy for 3:49 and sell for 5:00

UI (for approved roles only):
Inventory -> Chick-fil-A -> Menu
Actions Allowed:
View items (all users with CFA access)
Edit buy cost / sell price (approved roles)
Add new item (approved roles)
Disable/remove item (approved roles)
Fields (per CFA item):
itemId (string, unique)
name (string)
buyCostCents (int)
sellPriceCents (int)
active (boolean)

Daily Selling Log (form)
Meta:
date (YYYY-MM-DD)
dayType (A or B) (auto-detected, but editable with permission)
period (A→2, B→6) (auto)
Per item (for each active CFA item):
receivedQty (int) — how many you start with
leftoverQty (int) — how many remain at end
missedDemandQty (int) — # people who asked after sell-out (0 if none)

Auto-calculations (computed on save)

For each item:
soldQty = receivedQty - leftoverQty
trueDemandQty = soldQty + missedDemandQty
revenueCents = soldQty * sellPriceCents
cogsCents = soldQty * buyCostCents
profitCents = revenueCents - cogsCents
marginPct = profitCents / revenueCents (if revenueCents > 0)
Daily totals:
totalRevenueCents = Σ(revenueCents)
totalCogsCents = Σ(cogsCents)
totalProfitCents = Σ(profitCents)
stockoutFlag = (missedDemandQty > 0 for any item)

History + Analytics Views: 

1. Day-by-day history

Shows each date with:
dayType, period
soldQty, missedDemandQty, trueDemandQty per item
totalRevenue, totalProfit
Filters:
Date range
A vs B vs All
Item
Export: CSV export for regression / reporting

2. A-day vs B-day comparison

Charts + tables:
Avg soldQty per item on A vs B
Avg trueDemandQty per item on A vs B
Stockout frequency on A vs B
Profit/day on A vs B

3. Forecasting (regression-ready)

Goal: predict trueDemandQty separately for A and B.

Model plan: Since sales change based on day, there will be different predictive models for A-day and B-day.
A-day model per item
B-day model per item

Features stored/derived (minimum):
dayType (A/B)
weekday
month
trueDemandQty (target)
rolling averages (e.g., last 3 same-dayType sales)

Output:
Recommended stock quantity for next A-day / next B-day
Expected profit estimate using menu prices/costs

Permissions / Roles (required)
CFA Staff: submit Daily Log, view history
CFA Admin / Exec / Finance: edit menu items (cost/price), edit dayType override, export data

Notes (important):
This system does not require Lightspeed sales data. Lightspeed can be optional later for inventory validation, but the core process uses manual received/leftover + missed demand which is enough for profit/loss + forecasting.
